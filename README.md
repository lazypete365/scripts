# scripts
These are scripts written mostly for my personal use, but someone else might find a use for them.

They are at the "works for me" stage, so they should be treated as buggy, incomplete, unmaintained, poorly tested and mildly radioactive. But I am open to suggestions and I will try to keep them functional as long as I keep using them.

I do not maintain any proper documentation for them, at most I try to use the built-in functionality in argparse so that -h provides the basic command-line usage.

Also, some of the command line options might not be fully implemented. I tend to plan a bunch of extra features for my scripts, but when they do what I need them to do I often go "eeeeeh good enough" and leave several arguments coded but doing nothing.

|Script|Description|

|ff_exporter.py|Exports firefox history, bookmarks and open tabs as text files|
